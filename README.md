Create a Class with name ‘Greeter’ in greeter.ts and define Constructor and one ‘greet()’ method which will return some greeting message.
Then create a greeter.html, add compiled file into this html like(greeter.js).
Output should display as greeting message.

Create Interfaces and Class for implement them.

Interface: A simple interface that defines the interface for something that can drive:
interface Drivable {}, with start(), drive() and getPosition()

Class: An implementation of a car:
class Car implements Drivable {}

One more exercise for Interface and class as mentioned above:

interface Flyable { ... }
class Helicopter implements Flyable { ... }
class FlyingCar implements Drivable, Flyable { ... }
